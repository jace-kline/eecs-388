## Title: Deep Neural Network

## Procedure
1. Plug in the Raspberry Pi to the power and the HDMI 
2. Switch the display to the Raspberry Pi display on the monitor and log in
3. Download the source code and unzip it
4. Read the lab instructions
5. View the video file (epoch-1.avi) that is used as training data for the neural network
6. Observe the source code in the dnn.py file
7. Run timing tests on the dnn.py file while varying the number of CPU cores that the neural network utilizes
8. Record the following data for each test (1 <= CPU cores <= 4):
   * Mean time (average)
   * Max time (worst-case)
9. Plot the test data, one graph for each measure above as a function of CPU cores (see attached sheet)


## Conclusion

In this lab, I learned about the
